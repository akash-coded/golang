// Package Declaration:
// 'package mypackage' declares the name of the package. In Go, every file belongs to a package.
// This line names the package 'mypackage'. It's a convention to name the package the same as the last segment of its import path.
package mypackage

// Import Statement:
// This line imports the 'fmt' package from the Go standard library.
// The 'fmt' package is used for formatted I/O, including printing to the console.
import "fmt"

// Global Variable Declaration:
// 'var initializationVariable int' declares a global variable named 'initializationVariable' of type 'int' (integer).
// This variable is accessible to all functions within this package.
// It's not initialized here, so it will take the default value of 0 for its type (int).
var initializationVariable int

// init Function:
// The 'init' function is a special function in Go. It gets called automatically before the main function and
// is used for setup tasks like initializing global variables.
// Every package can have an init function, and it's called when the package is initialized.
func init() {
	// Variable Initialization:
	// Here, the global variable 'initializationVariable' is assigned a value of 42.
	initializationVariable = 42

	// Printing to the Console:
	// The 'fmt.Println' function is used to print a string to the console.
	// This indicates that the package initialization (including setting the 'initializationVariable') is complete.
	fmt.Println("Package initialization completed.")
}
